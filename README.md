Introduction
This project is a simple recreation of the Flappy Bird game. The game uses OpenGL for graphics rendering and GLUT for window management and user input handling. It demonstrates basic game development concepts such as physics, collision detection, and score tracking.

Features
Simple and intuitive controls
Basic physics for bird movement
Collision detection with pipes and ground
Score tracking
Game over condition
Requirements
To run this game, you need the following:

C++ Compiler
OpenGL
GLUT
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flappy-bird-cpp.git
cd flappy-bird-cpp
Install dependencies:

On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):
bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
On MacOS:
bash
Copy code
brew install freeglut
On Windows:
Download and install FreeGLUT from freeglut.sourceforge.net
Compile the code:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o flappybird flappybird.cpp -lglut -lGLU -lGL
Usage
To start the game, run the compiled executable:

bash

./flappybird
Game Mechanics
Controls:
Press the spacebar to make the bird jump.

Gameplay:
The bird falls due to gravity and can jump with the spacebar.
Pipes move from right to left.
The objective is to pass through the gaps between pipes without colliding.
The score increases each time the bird successfully passes through a gap.
The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
